// Arrays are objects that store multiple variables of the same type. However, 
// an array itself is an object on the heap. We will look into how to declare, construct,
// and initialize in the upcoming chapters.

// Enums restrict a variable to have one of only a few predefined values.

// The main rule of constructors is that they should have the same name as the class. 
// A class can have more than one constructor.
